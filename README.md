# Ring Network Simulation Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a computer network in an airport using a ring topology. It focuses on key aspects such as user authentication, data encryption, network speed monitoring, and file sharing. The network is modeled as a doubly linked list, emphasizing performance and security.

## Structure
- `Main.java`: The main driver of the simulation.
- `Node.java`: Represents a network node, handling specific roles within the network.
- `Ring.java`: Manages the ring network structure.

## Objectives
- To simulate airport staff network interactions.
- To implement security and performance optimizations.
- To demonstrate understanding of ring topology and linked lists.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality: modularity, comments.
- Security and performance justifications.
- Project explanation.
